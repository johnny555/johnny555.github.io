stranded at Millibrae station with only a thin hoodie and a 1 hour
wait for the next CalTrain. So I ordered a Lyft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daniel picked me up and offered me the use of the AUX cable. I showed
him some songs I enjoy, and showed him my "entrepreneur" soundtrack. I
think the music must've meant something to him because he excitedly
told me his dreams of revolutionising the video blogging industry, and
asked me "but HOW do I start?".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I gave him my card and said, "email me when you've spoken to 20 video
bloggers about your idea."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daniel immediately started making excuses,
"oh, but I have AD&amp;amp;D",
"I struggle to figure out how to execute on all of the ideas I have" and
"I'm not very good at sales" he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To Daniel's credit he took my card and offer anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good Luck Daniel! I look forward to hearing from you!&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Why I give people the EMU</title><link href="http://notes.johnvial.info/why-i-give-people-the-emu.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-06-21T00:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2017-06-21T00:00:00+08:00</updated><author><name>John Vial</name></author><id>tag:notes.johnvial.info,2017-06-21:/why-i-give-people-the-emu.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;At the moment I am handing out&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;At the moment I am handing out&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Starbucks Palo ALto</title><link href="http://notes.johnvial.info/starbucks-palo-alto.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-06-15T00:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2017-06-15T00:00:00+08:00</updated><author><name>John Vial</name></author><id>tag:notes.johnvial.info,2017-06-15:/starbucks-palo-alto.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;So I've decided that Starbucks is now my go-to coffee place.

coffee is poor, but cheap compared to other shops, and the internet is
reliably good and fast. What I didn't expect was to sit down and start
overhearing more conversations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across from me, a man and a lady appear to be discussing VC
investments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've got to make sure the value proposition fits for us. We usually
invest in funds that have already raised atleast 1.5 or 2 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually the pair conclude their meeting and leave, their rubbish
still on the table. Two minutes later an unkempt man swaggers into the
seating area and lifts up their empty coffee cup with a look of
disappointment. He then slaps their empty food bag, and realising it
contains half a roll, quickly grabs it and starts eating. He casually
surveys the area, gathers up some newspapers strewn on a nearby table,
and then calmly walks out as he chews on his prize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minutes later a woman walks in off the street, looks at the empty
coffee cup and puts it in the nearby bin. She then walks back out to
continue her journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During all of this a teenager explains to his younger brother the intricacies
of playing the Pokemon card game.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Red Rock Coffee Take 2</title><link href="http://notes.johnvial.info/red-rock-coffee-take-2.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-06-12T00:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2017-06-12T00:00:00+08:00</updated><author><name>John Vial</name></author><id>tag:notes.johnvial.info,2017-06-12:/red-rock-coffee-take-2.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Here I am again at the Red Rock cafe.

I sit here researching my competitors as I wait for a few meetings
that I have lined up at this place. Meanwhile...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across the room from me two young men drink from oversized coffee cups
(much like mine) while they duel each other in a game of Magic the
Gathering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To my right, a German (by his accent and his international power
charger), are plotting how to improve their app:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially we gave early users access to a tool my team, to help
them. Over time we added similar functionality for other users, and
now we have lots of tools that all do the same thing. We need to
consolidate!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I get up and go for a walk, I overhear:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sent the investor the wrong documents!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've now changed tables. To my right an undergraduate extols the
virtue's of MATLAB to her friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's just like a really big calculator.&lt;/p&gt;

Caltrain station stands the RedRock cafe. Wooden finishings and
liberal lick of red point is the theme. The coffee is good (by my
Australian standards too!) but the best thing is the conversations
that you overhear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behind me a young lady tries to convince her older co-founder or
possible investor that her startup is "just like Apple", and that if a
VC doesn't want to partner with them, then they probably just don't
get it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next to me two co-founders are consoling each other to keep going:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn't matter if they say that the problem may be too broad, as
 long as our assumptions are still correct there MUST be a market
 for it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a very out of character way, an older person is complaining about
how crap it is that his fridge is rusty. Ahh, rusty fridges, a
universal problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An older man appears to hold a phone interview at a nearby table. But
instead of asking technical questions seems to be judging his prospective
new hire by the age of his laptop. He also dismisses Apple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people think they [Apple] are innovative, and that they like to be
deliberate with their hardware, and that's why they don't always have the
latest ports. I just think they are lazy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, the Apple man decides to leave, citing that the cafe is not
that private. He is quickly replaced by two gents who unroll a Chess
board, and sit down with steaming tea. They speak in hushed tones as
they get ready to do battle, placing each piece down with a satisfying
knock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suddenly my ears pick up, the lady behind me has just asked her friend:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, &lt;pause&gt; I need you to write me a check!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a confident tone, the her friend replies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ofcourse I'll write you a check.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later in that same conversation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guy: It's really hard going after the consumers. You're not Apple.
Girl: But somebody has to go after the consumers! Bose, Bose just
bought it.
... see that's the problem, I care, I care about people. If I sell
the company and somebody buys it ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later again&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Girl: Is that REALLY true or are you just saying that to be positive?
Well, I'm glad it's happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they get up and leave the coffee shop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Random comments from another table:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They added psuedo-random bubbles into the pipeline. I'm pretty sure
it's patented.
...
I spent most of my time fighting internal, I'm never doing that again.
...
People are gonna fight for resources...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The volume of the cafe comes and goes, with the crowd sometimes
fighting against the music, but other-times everyone seems to agree that
it's time to be quiet, and a brief lull descends upon the room.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Getting a 10x</title><link href="http://notes.johnvial.info/getting-a-10x.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-05-08T00:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2017-05-08T00:00:00+08:00</updated><author><name>John Vial</name></author><id>tag:notes.johnvial.info,2017-05-08:/getting-a-10x.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;What approach links Jeremy Howard and Elon Musk?

I recently watched Elon's &lt;a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/elon_musk_the_future_we_re_building_and_boring"&gt;interview on TEDx&lt;/a&gt;, and I've also been watching Part 2 of the Fast.AI course by Jeremy Howard, in particular, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfhLSTkRZLI&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be"&gt;lesson 9&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elon was talking about building a 10x solution to boring machines. He broke it down into sub components, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Boring at the front and reinforcing at the back can give a 2x speed up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The cost of boring is proportional to the diameter of the hole, by halving the diameter we can get a 4x cost reduction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By using the machine closer to it's thermal and energy limit we can get another 1.5x.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elon, then multiplied these (2x4x1.5) and claimed that it was
approximately a 10x speed improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeremy also performed a similar calculation, but instead of 10x'ing a business, he was 10x'ing computation speed. Jeremy's logic was as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can use SIMD to get a 6x speed up for computation that has been
  optimized to use the SIMD instructions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can use Parallel processing to usally get 2-4x speed up on a standard computer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeremy then claims that you can add these (6 + 4) to get a roughly 10x speed up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's interesting that they disagree on how to combine the
improvement. However, they both follow a similar logical path. I think
that this is a good way to build up a 10x advantage where no
single technology can get you there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I think that you should add you multiplicatives, not multiply them, see standard algebra.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry></feed>
