</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>I'm trying to understand the advertising world, the following
link helped me. <a href="http://studybreakmedia.com/glossary">Advertising Glossary</a>.</p>
<p>I've typed out many of the terms to help me remember them. Perhaps it will help you as well:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Ad Tag</em> Javascript that coordinates serving of ads to the user.</li>
<li><em>Ad Network</em> and <em>Auction Price Floor</em>. I've understood that ad spots were an auction, I always thought it was one of those strange auctions that benefit the seller the most. I think it was called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_auction">Dutch Auction</a>.</li>
<li><em>Creative</em> Refers to a piece of work (graphic or text) that is created, I also think it could mean a person who creates that work too.</li>
<li><em>Daisy chain (Ad Chain)</em> This term seems confusing even after having read the description. The description describes arranging ads by price, but why call it a daisy chain??</li>
<li><em>Discrepancy</em> Another confusing term, I think it means the difference between the clients (viewers) and ad partners (people with ads to serve).</li>
<li><em>DSP</em> Not Digital Signal Processing, but instead Demand Side Platform, apparently a marketplace to sell ad <em>inventory</em>.</li>
<li><em>IAB</em> Interactive Advertising Bureau. I guess this is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_organisation">Peak Body</a> for advertising industry.</li>
<li><em>Passback Tag</em> Apparently an ad partner can choose to pass on the opportunity to serve an ad. I wonder if they still pay for the space.</li>
<li><em>Revenue Share Model</em> Describes how much of the advertising revenue the publisher gets vs the ad provider. (The publisher is some website, the provider is an exchange like Google's Ad Exchange).</li>
<li><em>RTB (Real Time Bidding)</em> Allows advertisers to bid on ad slots in real time.</li>
<li><em>SSP (Supply Side Platform)</em> Allows publishers to sell their websites inventory to sell.</li>
<li><em>View-ability</em> A "new" metric, will be true if 50% of ads are displayed for atleast 1 second. I wonder how much of a problem very quickly displayed ads were for this metric to be introduced.</li>
<li><em>Volume</em> How many impressions or pageviews a website receives.</li>
<li><em>CPA (Cost Per Action)</em>, i.e. the customer must take an action for the advertiser to get paid.</li>
<li><em>CPC (Cost Per Click)</em> CPA where the action is a click.</li>
<li><em>CPM (Cost Per Milli)</em> Confusingly, this is per 1000 impressions, not 1e6 impressions.</li>
<li><em>eCPM (effective CPM)</em> Tries to compensate for impressions that we're actually shown or paid.</li>
<li><em>rCPM (real CPM)</em> A metric that takes into account the impressions that occurred. Apparently not all impressions are paid??</li>
<li><em>ATF (Above The Fold)</em>, i.e. the first part of the website.</li>
<li><em>Ad Units</em> The space where an ad is displayed.</li>
<li><em>Banner/Leader board, Rectangle, Tower/Skyscraper</em> Terms to describe the shape of the ad unit.</li>
<li><em>BTF (Below The Fold)</em> Opposite of ATF.</li>
<li><em>Native ads</em> Advertising that blends into the user experience.</li>
<li><em>Rich Media</em> Apparently this is richer advertising, I'm not sure I've encountered these before.</li>
<li><em>Rising Stars</em> A "more standardised" version of Rich Media.</li>
<li><em>Site Skin</em> Creative that appears behind the main content of the page. I think I've seen <a href="http://www.ebay.com">e-bay</a> do that before.</li>
<li><em>Ad Impression</em> A single ad view, can be purchased.</li>
<li><em>Bounce Rate</em> The percentage of users that click an ad but immediately leave the linked site.</li>
<li><em>Pageview</em> whenever a user loads a page, a pageview occurs.</li>
<li><em>Re-Targeting pixel</em> A unique identifier that tracks user behaviour allowing targeted ads. It's weird that this is called a pixel.</li>
<li><em>Visitor</em> Total count of users visiting a site. Includes multiple visits by the same person.</li>
<li><em>Cachebuster</em> To avoid the browser caching an old ad, the source code is modified by adding a unique number for each site visit, to "bust the cache" so that the new ad is actually served.</li>
<li><em>DMA (Designated Market Area)</em> The actual geographic region that an advertiser wants to advertise in.</li>
<li><em>Flight</em> How long the ads will run for, a time measurement.</li>
<li><em>Frequency Cap</em> The max number of times an ad can be shown to a unique user.</li>
<li><em>Geo-targeting</em> Seems similar to DMA.</li>
<li><em>Invocation code</em> I think this may be synonymous with Ad Tag. Refers to the code placed on a website that "summons" an ad.</li>
<li><em>Line Item</em> A single unit of advertising.</li>
<li><em>Order</em> A group of line items.</li>
<li><em>Roadblock (Takeover)</em> When an advertiser takes over ever available ad spot on a page, this is called a RoadBlock or Takeover.</li>
<li><em>ROS (Run of Site)</em> Not sure about this definition. Seems to mean that you indicate a site to have your ads run on (such as google.com).</li>
<li><em>SOV (Share of Voice)</em> The percentage of a particular advertisers inventory that an advertiser owns during a campaign.</li>
</ul>
