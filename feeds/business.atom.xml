&lt;p&gt;The instructions seemed simple enough, "Your key is in the door, the code is ….". I find myself fumbling with the padlock that is hooked around the front door, the clanging gets the attention of a resident, and they approach the door just as I get it open. I place my key in my pocket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sunlight illuminates the spartan scene before me. Mattresses line the lounge room floor, the only other furniture being 2 foldable tables and a lonely chair. Luggage and linen cover the other floor surfaces. I inspect the kitchen, only to told by my guide that I'm 'lucky'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Last week", he informs me, "there were twice as many people here, and see that space" he motions to where the dining room table should be, "I slept there last week".
"I just wish people respected the place more, I mean, why should I have to wash up the dirty dishes of everyone else when I want to cook, and nobody has ever cleaned the bathroom!".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A young indian man, who currently studies at Stanford but is interning with a nearby technology company, grimly informs me that he has found other accommodation, but that this experience has cost him almost $300 USD because the cancellation policy is so bad. I feel for the guy, there is no way I would want to spend 3 months living on a lounge room floor, in what can only be described as a slum!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decide to hunt for my room, a '2 person share room with half bathroom in a renovated apartment, bed C-1'. Suddenly I notice the prison like indicators above each bed, D, E and F appear to be lounge room beds, I suddenly hope that the C tag isn't for the other unlabelled bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully I find a room as described, with the scent of new carpet filling my lungs I plunge into my hospice. Fortunately, only 1 bed exists in this 2 bedroom share room, so I really am living in luxury, and my god, the bed even has sheets and a pillow!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day I get a message from my host "I've overbooked the your room, would you mind moving into the lounge room for tonight?".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm writing this from a comfortable, WiFi enabled bus that is taking
me from San Jose to Santa Cruz. I have enough space, get to see a nice
view out of the window, don't have to concentrate on driving and it'll
only take me an hour to get to my destination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People often complain about the CalTrain service between San Francisco
and Palo Alto. However, their usual complaint is that it's 1 hour
between services, yet they forget that it's an extremely fast way of
getting around and pretty damn economical. The chairs are also really
large, some of them even have tables and a power outlet. I can't
imagine a more pleasent way of getting around!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good on you Bay Area public transport!&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Good luck Daniel!</title><link href="http://notes.johnvial.info/good-luck-daniel.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-06-21T00:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2017-06-21T00:00:00+08:00</updated><author><name>John Vial</name></author><id>tag:notes.johnvial.info,2017-06-21:/good-luck-daniel.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last night the Bay Area public transport system failed me, leaving me

stranded at Millibrae station with only a thin hoodie and a 1 hour

&lt;p&gt;Daniel picked me up and offered me the use of the AUX cable. I showed
him some songs I enjoy, and showed him my "entrepreneur" soundtrack. I
think the music must've meant something to him because he excitedly
told me his dreams of revolutionising the video blogging industry, and
asked me "but HOW do I start?".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I gave him my card and said, "email me when you've spoken to 20 video
bloggers about your idea."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daniel immediately started making excuses,
"oh, but I have AD&amp;amp;D",
"I struggle to figure out how to execute on all of the ideas I have" and
"I'm not very good at sales" he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To Daniel's credit he took my card and offer anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good Luck Daniel! I look forward to hearing from you!&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Why I give people the EMU</title><link href="http://notes.johnvial.info/why-i-give-people-the-emu.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-06-21T00:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2017-06-21T00:00:00+08:00</updated><author><name>John Vial</name></author><id>tag:notes.johnvial.info,2017-06-21:/why-i-give-people-the-emu.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Emu Business Card" src="/images/emu.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

going to be giving out my EMU cards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just wanted to let you know that if you've got one of these, you
have something that is quite special to me. The EMU logo, is the logo
I made for my first ever startup venture, a failed headphone importing
business named emurunning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made alot of mistakes with Emurunning. I bought 100 headphones from
China before I knew that could actually sell them! I also entered a
market where my hard-earned skills were completely useless, that is,
there was no way I could add value to the product by using my robotics
background. Ultimately, it was a play in marketing, and truly I sold
an overpriced product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did get some sales though, and I think I did deliver the $60 worth
of value I had charged. I even experienced the ire of the internet when I
posted it on a local deals website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though I quit that business, I proudly use its logo. It's a cool
Emu, made for $50 from an artist in Sri-Lanka for me, and it
represents my first step of this entrepreneurial journey I have
started.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Starbucks Palo ALto</title><link href="http://notes.johnvial.info/starbucks-palo-alto.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-06-15T00:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2017-06-15T00:00:00+08:00</updated><author><name>John Vial</name></author><id>tag:notes.johnvial.info,2017-06-15:/starbucks-palo-alto.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;So I've decided that Starbucks is now my go-to coffee place.

coffee is poor, but cheap compared to other shops, and the internet is
reliably good and fast. What I didn't expect was to sit down and start
overhearing more conversations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across from me, a man and a lady appear to be discussing VC
investments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've got to make sure the value proposition fits for us. We usually
invest in funds that have already raised atleast 1.5 or 2 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually the pair conclude their meeting and leave, their rubbish
still on the table. Two minutes later an unkempt man swaggers into the
seating area and lifts up their empty coffee cup with a look of
disappointment. He then slaps their empty food bag, and realising it
contains half a roll, quickly grabs it and starts eating. He casually
surveys the area, gathers up some newspapers strewn on a nearby table,
and then calmly walks out as he chews on his prize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minutes later a woman walks in off the street, looks at the empty
coffee cup and puts it in the nearby bin. She then walks back out to
continue her journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During all of this a teenager explains to his younger brother the intricacies
of playing the Pokemon card game.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Red Rock Coffee Take 2</title><link href="http://notes.johnvial.info/red-rock-coffee-take-2.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-06-12T00:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2017-06-12T00:00:00+08:00</updated><author><name>John Vial</name></author><id>tag:notes.johnvial.info,2017-06-12:/red-rock-coffee-take-2.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Here I am again at the Red Rock cafe.

&lt;p&gt;Across the room from me two young men drink from oversized coffee cups
(much like mine) while they duel each other in a game of Magic the
Gathering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To my right, a German (by his accent and his international power
charger), are plotting how to improve their app:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially we gave early users access to a tool my team, to help
them. Over time we added similar functionality for other users, and
now we have lots of tools that all do the same thing. We need to
consolidate!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I get up and go for a walk, I overhear:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sent the investor the wrong documents!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've now changed tables. To my right an undergraduate extols the
virtue's of MATLAB to her friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's just like a really big calculator.&lt;/p&gt;

Caltrain station stands the RedRock cafe. Wooden finishings and
liberal lick of red point is the theme. The coffee is good (by my
Australian standards too!) but the best thing is the conversations
that you overhear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behind me a young lady tries to convince her older co-founder or
possible investor that her startup is "just like Apple", and that if a
VC doesn't want to partner with them, then they probably just don't
get it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next to me two co-founders are consoling each other to keep going:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn't matter if they say that the problem may be too broad, as
 long as our assumptions are still correct there MUST be a market
 for it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a very out of character way, an older person is complaining about
how crap it is that his fridge is rusty. Ahh, rusty fridges, a
universal problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An older man appears to hold a phone interview at a nearby table. But
instead of asking technical questions seems to be judging his prospective
new hire by the age of his laptop. He also dismisses Apple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people think they [Apple] are innovative, and that they like to be
deliberate with their hardware, and that's why they don't always have the
latest ports. I just think they are lazy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, the Apple man decides to leave, citing that the cafe is not
that private. He is quickly replaced by two gents who unroll a Chess
board, and sit down with steaming tea. They speak in hushed tones as
they get ready to do battle, placing each piece down with a satisfying
knock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suddenly my ears pick up, the lady behind me has just asked her friend:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, &lt;pause&gt; I need you to write me a check!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a confident tone, the her friend replies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ofcourse I'll write you a check.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later in that same conversation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guy: It's really hard going after the consumers. You're not Apple.
Girl: But somebody has to go after the consumers! Bose, Bose just
bought it.
... see that's the problem, I care, I care about people. If I sell
the company and somebody buys it ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later again&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Girl: Is that REALLY true or are you just saying that to be positive?
Well, I'm glad it's happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they get up and leave the coffee shop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Random comments from another table:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They added psuedo-random bubbles into the pipeline. I'm pretty sure
it's patented.
...
I spent most of my time fighting internal, I'm never doing that again.
...
People are gonna fight for resources...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The volume of the cafe comes and goes, with the crowd sometimes
fighting against the music, but other-times everyone seems to agree that
it's time to be quiet, and a brief lull descends upon the room.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Getting a 10x</title><link href="http://notes.johnvial.info/getting-a-10x.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-05-08T00:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2017-05-08T00:00:00+08:00</updated><author><name>John Vial</name></author><id>tag:notes.johnvial.info,2017-05-08:/getting-a-10x.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;What approach links Jeremy Howard and Elon Musk?

&lt;p&gt;Elon was talking about building a 10x solution to boring machines. He broke it down into sub components, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Boring at the front and reinforcing at the back can give a 2x speed up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The cost of boring is proportional to the diameter of the hole, by halving the diameter we can get a 4x cost reduction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By using the machine closer to it's thermal and energy limit we can get another 1.5x.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elon, then multiplied these (2x4x1.5) and claimed that it was
approximately a 10x speed improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeremy also performed a similar calculation, but instead of 10x'ing a business, he was 10x'ing computation speed. Jeremy's logic was as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can use SIMD to get a 6x speed up for computation that has been
  optimized to use the SIMD instructions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can use Parallel processing to usally get 2-4x speed up on a standard computer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeremy then claims that you can add these (6 + 4) to get a roughly 10x speed up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's interesting that they disagree on how to combine the
improvement. However, they both follow a similar logical path. I think
that this is a good way to build up a 10x advantage where no
single technology can get you there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I think that you should add you multiplicatives, not multiply them, see standard algebra.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry></feed>
