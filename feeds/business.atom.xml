I recently watched Elon's &lt;a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/elon_musk_the_future_we_re_building_and_boring"&gt;interview on TEDx&lt;/a&gt;, and I've also been watching Part 2 of the Fast.AI course by Jeremy Howard, in particular, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfhLSTkRZLI&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be"&gt;lesson 9&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elon was talking about building a 10x solution to boring machines. He broke it down into sub components, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Boring at the front and reinforcing at the back can give a 2x speed up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The cost of boring is proportional to the diameter of the hole, by halving the diameter we can get a 4x cost reduction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By using the machine closer to it's thermal and energy limit we can get another 1.5x.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elon, then multiplied these (2x4x1.5) and claimed that it was
approximately a 10x speed improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeremy also performed a similar calculation, but instead of 10x'ing a business, he was 10x'ing computation speed. Jeremy's logic was as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can use SIMD to get a 6x speed up for computation that has been
  optimized to use the SIMD instructions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can use Parallel processing to usally get 2-4x speed up on a standard computer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeremy then claims that you can add these (6 + 4) to get a roughly 10x speed up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's interesting that they disagree on how to combine the
improvement. However, they both follow a similar logical path. I think
that this is a good way to build up a 10x advantage where no
single technology can get you there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I think that you should add you multiplicatives, not multiply them, see standard algebra.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry></feed>
